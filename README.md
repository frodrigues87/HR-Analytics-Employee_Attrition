# Enterprise Data Science Bootcamp Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition using data science techniques. It is a comprehensive exploration of HR data, aiming to provide actionable insights for HR departments to control and reduce employee turnover.

## Project Structure

### Data Files
- `HR_DS.csv`: The dataset used for analysis and model training.

### Jupyter Notebooks / Python
- `EDA.ipynb` and `test_HR.ipynb`: Perform exploratory data analysis on the HR dataset.
- `model_test_1.ipynb` and `model_test_2.ipynb`: Test several Machine Learning Models with different variables.
- `model_final.ipynb`: The final model after various testing phases.
- `Model_script.py`: A script of our final model, to be used in PowerBI.
- `HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix`: A PowerBI dashboard for HR departments to monitor and control employee attrition.
- `Human Resources Analysis Predict Attrition.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation of the project.

### Documentation
- `NOVA_IMS_-_Human-Resources-Employee-Attrition.pdf`: Project documentation.

### Miscellaneous
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Required libraries for this project
- `README.md`: Instructions and overview of the project (this file).

## Installation

Instructions on how to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the repo**

   To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. If you're not familiar with how to clone a repository, you can find the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

   If you have git command line installed, use the following command:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmfsilvaj/Data-Science-Bootcamp.git
   \`\`\`

2. **Cd to the folder**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository's folder. If you need help changing directories, you can find the instructions [here](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000772.htm).

   You can change the directory with the following command:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd path/to/your/cloned/folder
   \`\`\`

3. **Install the PIP packages/dependencies**

   Once you're in the correct folder, you should see your prompt change to indicate you're in the project directory. If not, make sure you've navigated to the right directory.

   Then, install the required packages by running:

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

   This will install all the necessary Python libraries listed in your `requirements.txt` file.
