# Enterprise Data Science Bootcamp Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition using data science techniques. It is a comprehensive exploration of HR data, aiming to provide actionable insights for HR departments to control and reduce employee turnover.

## Project Contents

### Data Files
- `HR_DS.csv`: The dataset used for analysis and model training.

### Data Analysis Notebooks
- `EDA.ipynb`: Perform exploratory data analysis on the HR dataset.
- `test_HR.ipynb`: Perform exploratory data analysis on the HR dataset.

### Machine Learning Models
- `model_test_1.ipynb`: Test several Machine Learning Models with different variables.
- `model_test_2.ipynb`: Test several Machine Learning Models with different variables.
- `model_final.ipynb`: The final model after various testing phases.
- `Model_script.py`: A script of our final model, to be used in PowerBI.

### Visualization and Reporting
- `HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix`: A PowerBI dashboard for HR departments to monitor and control employee attrition.
- `Human Resources Analysis Predict Attrition.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project findings and methodology.

### Project Documentation
- `NOVA_IMS_-_Human-Resources-Employee-Attrition.pdf`: Project documentation.

### Miscellaneous
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Required libraries for this project
- `README.md`: Instructions and overview of the project (this file).

## Installation

Instructions on how to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the repo**

   To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. If you're not familiar with how to clone a repository, you can find the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

   If you have git command line installed, use the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jmfsilvaj/Data-Science-Bootcamp.git
   ```

2. **Cd to the folder**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository's folder.

   You can change the directory with the following command:

   ```
   cd path/to/your/cloned/folder
   ```

3. **Install the PIP packages/dependencies**

   Once you're in the correct folder, you should see your prompt change to indicate you're in the project directory. If not, make sure you've navigated to the right directory.

   Then, install the required packages by running:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary Python libraries listed in your `requirements.txt` file.


## Usage

To get the most out of this project, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Project Overview**
   Begin by viewing the project presentation to understand the scope, methodology, and findings of our analysis:
   - Open the `Human Resources Analysis Predict Attrition.pptx` PowerPoint file.

2. **Data Analysis Exploration**
   Dive deeper into the data with our Jupyter Notebooks that detail the exploratory data analysis process:
   - Start with `EDA.ipynb` for an initial exploration of the HR dataset.
   - Continue with `test_HR.ipynb` for further analysis.

3. **Machine Learning Model Insights**
   Review the process of model selection and the performance of various algorithms:
   - Examine `model_test_1.ipynb` and `model_test_2.ipynb` to see the tests performed on different machine learning models.
   - Check out `model_final.ipynb` to understand the final model chosen for deployment.

4. **Interactive Dashboard**
   For interactive data exploration and visual analysis, load the PowerBI dashboard:
   - Open `HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix` in PowerBI to explore the data and gain insights through a Business Intelligence tool.

By following these steps, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of our project's approach to predicting employee attrition and how data science techniques can be applied to HR data.
